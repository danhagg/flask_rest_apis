# VERBS
A web server is designed to accept incoming web requests

GET request
VERB PATH PROTOCOL
GET / HTTP/1.1

The server see request and responds with give you error if / not found or HTTP not supported of if server not available

Normally gives html or text

GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: https://twitter.com

Going to a page will always do a get REQUEST,

There are other verbs:
GET - Retrive something GET /item/1
POST - Receive data and use it POST /item
PUT -  Make something there PUT /item
DELETE - Remove something DELETE /item/1

# REST API
Uses verbs above.
REST is a way of thinking about how web server respomds to request.

REST API doesnt just respond with data it responds with resources.

GET /item/chair
POST /item/chair
PUT /item/chair
DELETE /item/chair

All above endpoints access same resource... chair element of item resource

REST is also supposed to be stateless. All requests independent. One request does not depend on any other requests

POST /item/chair creates item. Now forgets about it. Then GET /item/chair goes to db and checks if item there.

So...
1. resources
2. Stateless
